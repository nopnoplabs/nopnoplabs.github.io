      <description>What is it? PacketCTF is a capture the flag (CTF) game using packet capture files (pcaps)Participants will download and analyze pcaps using Wireshark to answer questions on the game board. PacketCTF uses a jeopardy-style game board. Questions and collaboration are encouraged, but players will compete as individuals (no teams please).
Wireshark skills will be demonstrated throughout the workshop and prizes will be awarded for top finishers.
This event is for all skill levels.</description>
